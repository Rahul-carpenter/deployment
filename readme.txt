app/                    --> Your main Flask application code (views, templates, models)
app.wsgi                --> WSGI entrypoint for Apache/mod_wsgi
config.py               --> Configuration for Flask (DB URI, secret key, etc.)
Dockerfile              --> Image build instructions for Flask app
.dockerignore           --> Tells Docker what to ignore while building the image
docker-compose.yml      --> Defines and runs multi-container Docker apps
.env                    --> Stores environment variables (like DB_HOST, DB_USER)
migrations/             --> Alembic folder for database schema versions
__pycache__/            --> Python cache folder (auto-generated)
.qodo/                  --> Likely an editor/project setting folder (you can ignore this)
requirements.txt        --> Python packages your app needs
run.py                  --> Your Flask app’s main entry script (for development)
venv/                   --> Python virtual environment (not needed inside Docker)





✅ Files/Folders You Can Safely Remove or Ignore (when using Docker Compose)
🗑️ 1. venv/ folder
❌ Not needed because Docker uses its own isolated Python environment inside the container.

✅ You install dependencies using requirements.txt inside the container.

💡 Delete it:

bash
Copy
Edit
rm -rf venv/
🗑️ 2. run.py
❌ Not needed if you're using gunicorn or Apache + app.wsgi in production.

✅ If you're running via gunicorn or mod_wsgi, Docker will start the app using that — not run.py.

✅ Keep it only if:

You want to run the app locally without Docker (e.g. python run.py).

🗑️ 3. __pycache__/
❌ Useless in Docker.

✅ It's just Python’s cache; no harm in deleting:

bash
Copy
Edit
rm -rf __pycache__/
Also, add it to .dockerignore and .gitignore.

❌ You should NOT delete:
File/Folder	Reason
Dockerfile	Used to build your app container
docker-compose.yml	Defines all services (Flask + MySQL)
app/	Your actual Flask code
requirements.txt	Used to install packages inside Docker
.env	Holds environment variables (DB info, secret key)
config.py	Used to load environment-specific configs
app.wsgi	Used when serving Flask via Apache or mod_wsgi
migrations/	For tracking database schema (Alembic)

✅ Final File List for Docker Compose Project
After cleaning:

arduino
Copy
Edit
app/
app.wsgi
config.py
Dockerfile
.dockerignore
docker-compose.yml
.env
migrations/
requirements.txt
⚠️ You can keep run.py optionally for local testing, but it won’t be used inside Docker.

Let me know if you want me to:

Show exact updated .dockerignore

Help clean up your repo

Add optional Makefile or entrypoint.sh for automation

You're doing great, Rj — this is how real-world production apps are structured!
